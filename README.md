This repository contains the source code for various mechanisms of consuming **REST APIs** in Spring, like RestTemplate, WebClient and others discussed in series of articles @ [TechSphere](https://techsphere.dev/).

## How to use the repository

The code snapshots are organized in multiple branches where every branch represents a different mechanism of consuming REST APIs as shown in the articles.

For example, the branch [01_spring_resttemplate](https://github.com/ishailendra/spring-rest-api-handling/tree/01_spring_resttemplate) is source code for consuming REST APIs using Spring RestTemplate.
